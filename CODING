Building Unity 8
================

Only Ubuntu 13.10 (saucy) is supported as a developement environment.

download source
---------------
- create a parent folder to not pollute your setup. so that you can have different unity
  branches there (trunk, WIP etc)
  $ mkdir ~/unity

- fetch Unity 8 source
  $ sudo apt-get install bzr
  $ bzr branch lp:unity/8.0 ~/unity/8.0
  $ cd ~/unity/8.0

install dependencies
--------------------
If its your first time, install build dependencies
$ ./build --setup
  this will:
  - add ppa:phablet-team/desktop-deps, ppa:canonical-qt5-edgers/qt5-proper, ppa:ubuntu-sdk-team
  - install build dependencies

build Unity 8
-------------
$ ./build

Running Unity 8 on your desktop
===============================

run the Unity 8 shell
---------------------
$ cd ~/unity/unity8
$ ./run

Notes
-----
- to navigate, utilize the mouse left button as you would your finger
- to get the translations work, currently you have to do make install to
  put the *.mo files into correct structure. We'll look for a better solution
  later.
  $ cd builddir; make install

Running Unity 8 on devices
==========================
- Ubuntu Touch builds are currently only available in 13.10 flavour
- supported hardware should match one those listed here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Touch/Devices#Running_fine
- follow the Ubuntu Touch install instructions for your chosen device https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Touch/Install
- make sure your device is connected to a WiFi network
- also make sure you have your SSH key in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (or install one on the device yourself)

$ cd ~/unity/8.0
$ ./run_on_device --setup
  this will:
  - install your public SSH key on the device
  - add ppa:canonical-qt5-edgers/qt5-proper and ppa:phablet-team
  - install the needed dependencies

$ ./run_on_device
  this will:
  - rsync the code to the device
  - build on the device
  - replace the running shell

Notes
-----
- using adb over TCP has some advantages, Google will be of help here
  - TL;DR: `adb tcpip 5555; adb connect $your_device_ip`
  - you can persist the above via `adb shell setprop persist.adb.tcp.port 5555`
  - it's unsafe - anyone can connect to your device
  - with TCP the Nexus 10 doesn't drop the adb connection when locking the screen
- exporting ANDROID_SERIAL=$your_device_serial or ANDROID_SERIAL=$your_device_ip:5555
  will make adb not complain about multiple devices 
- you can export TARGET_IP=$your_device_ip TARGET_SSH_PORT=22 for run_on_device
  to not use adb forwarding - useful if you use multiple devices
- using Ninja (package ninja-build - run_on_device -s installs this now) will improve
  build times (especially in the nothing-to-build case)


Coding guidelines

Development Environment
=======================
QtCreator (available via the Software Center) is the best IDE to hack on Unity 8.

If using VIM, make sure you install some syntax highlighting for QML, like
